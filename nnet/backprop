Basic principle

z(i,j) = activation value  = ∑ [w(i,j) * a(i-1,k)+b(i,j)]
where a(i,j) = σ(z) = output

The general formula of the backpropagation of the cost is of the form:
		δL=∇aC ⊙ σ′(zi)


where 	δL is the backpropagation
	∇aC is the gradient of the cost
	⊙ represents the hadamard product
	σ′(zi) is the derivative of the activation.(here σ′(zi) is the function sigmoid prime)

We are using the cross entropy cost function of the form :

	CCE(W,B,Sr,Er)=−∑j[Erj ln aLj+(1−Erj) ln (1−aLj)]


using this type of cost function, we get: 
	∇aCCE=(a^L−E^r)(1−a^L)(a^L)

where 	a^L is the activation
and 	E^r is the expected output/activation
and 	σ′(zi) = (1−a^L)(a^L)



but from the general formula, we can deduce that

	δ^L = (a^L - E^r)


Hence the backpropagation function is δ^L = (a^L - E^r)
